# Contact-Management-System
In this activity, you will create a simple Contact Management System in Java that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of contacts stored in a text file (contacts.txt).

Your program must implement the following functionalities:

1. Add Contact: Appends a new name to contacts.txt.
2. View Contacts: Reads from contacts.txt and displays all names.
3. Update Contact: Searches for a name in contacts.txt and replaces it with a new name if found.  If the name does not exist, an error message should be displayed, and the user should be prompted to return to the main menu.
4. Delete Contact: Removes a specified name from contacts.txt. If the name does not exist, an error message should be displayed, and the user should be prompted to return to the main menu.
